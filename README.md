igs.js (JoshDraw)
=================

This is an experimental browser-based art program for drawing images that can be exported in the ["Instant Graphics and Sound" (IGS)](https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Instant_Graphics_and_Sound_(IGS)) format.


Not a release
-------------

* The code in this repository is awful and messy, and is not really meant for public consumption. Future versions will be cleaner and have some documentation.
